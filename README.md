# Dragon Balls
## Description: 
Dragon Balls is a simple web game similar to gomoku. In vanilla gomoku, the player plays on a 19 * 19 go board and whoever achieves **five in a row** first -i.e. five consecutive stones- wins. 

In Dragon Balls, you can not only customize the size of your go board, but also set a **magic number** to replace **five**. The black and white stones are replaced by the dragon balls as a parody to the manga “Dragon Ball.” In the original setting, a person who successfully collects seven dragon balls is able to summon the Shenron and make a wish. In this game, you can collect your own dragon balls and summon the dragon by clicking on the go board! There is only one thing of concern: your opponent may summon the dragon before you and take away your wish!
